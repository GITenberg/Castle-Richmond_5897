description: "Castle Richmond is the third of five novels set in Ireland by Anthony\
  \ Trollope. Castle Richmond was written between 4 August 1859 and 31 March 1860,\
  \ and was published in three volumes on 10 May 1860. It was his tenth novel. Trollope\
  \ signed the contract for the novel on 2 August 1859. He received £600, £200 more\
  \ than the payment for his previous novel, The Bertrams, reflecting his growing\
  \ popular success.\nCastle Richmond is set in southwestern Ireland at beginning\
  \ of the Irish famine. Castle Richmond is situated on the banks of the Blackwater\
  \ River in County Cork. Trollope's work in Ireland from 1841 to 1859 had given him\
  \ an extensive knowledge of the island, and Richard Mullen has written that \"All\
  \ the principal strands of his life were formed in Ireland.\"\nThe unusually (for\
  \ Trollope) complicated plot features the competition of two Protestant cousins\
  \ of English origin, Owen Fitzgerald and Herbert Fitzgerald, for the hand of Clara\
  \ Desmond, the noble but impoverished daughter of the widowed Countess of Desmond,\
  \ providing the novel's principal dramatic interest. Castle Richmond was the first\
  \ of several novels by Trollope in which bigamy played an important role.\nThe Irish\
  \ famine and efforts by authorities to mitigate its effects are the subject of many\
  \ scenes and the object of abundant commentary throughout. The famine also occasions\
  \ more explicit religious commentary than is typical in novels by Trollope.\nThe\
  \ critical reception to the novel was limited but generally favourable. However,\
  \ Castle Richmond did not sell particularly well.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
